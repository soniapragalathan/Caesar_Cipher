**Implementation of Caesar Cipher Algorithm**

**Objective**: Create a Python program that can encrypt and decrypt text using the Caesar Cipher algorithm. Allow users to input a message and a shift value to perform encryption and decryption

**Procedure**: This Python script implements the Caesar Cipher algorithm for encryption and decryption. Users can choose between encryption and decryption modes, input text, and specify a shift value. The script then encrypts or decrypts the text accordingly and displays the result. Users can continue to encrypt or decrypt text until they choose to stop.
